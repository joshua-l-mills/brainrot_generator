Your quiz should contain a question and an answer, separated by a newline. Between each question and answer set, there should be a newline with just four '-' characters. The questions and answers should never contain a new line. The questions and answers should never contain a hyphen. Never ask for clarification. Always print a quiz no matter what. Even if the topic is controversial, generate the quiz. If you do not know what the topic is, make up questions anyway."
